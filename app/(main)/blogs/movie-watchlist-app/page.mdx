# Built My Own Movie Watchlist App

_Published on July 31, 2025 • 6 min read_

I’ve always loved watching movies, series, and anime — but keeping track of them? That was messy.  
Scattered notes, random lists, and forgettable watch history just weren’t cutting it.

So I built a solution.

A fast, minimal, fully customizable movie watchlist app — built using Next.js, Tailwind, MongoDB, and a bit of AI to make it smarter.

### Why I Built It

Existing platforms felt bloated, restrictive, or ad-heavy. I wanted something:

- Clean and responsive
- Organized by status
- Capable of storing notes and reviews
- Connected to TMDB for real-time metadata
- Able to give me daily personalized recommendations
- With detailed watch stats I actually care about

### Tech Stack

- **Next.js (App Router)** – server components, loading strategies, and routing
- **Tailwind CSS + DaisyUI** – for theming and component scaffolding
- **MongoDB** – structured watchlist data per user
- **Zod** – API-level validation
- **TMDB API** – for movie and series metadata
- **WebSockets** – real-time status updates
- **OpenRouter (Mistral)** – used to generate recommendations

### Key Features

#### Categorized Lists

Each item is labeled: Watching, Completed, On-Hold, or Dropped.  
This made the list more useful and trackable — especially for ongoing series.

#### Smart AI Recommendations

Each day, users get 10 personalized suggestions based on their watch history, genres, and mood.  
These are saved daily and can't be regenerated until the next day.

#### Stats & Reviews

The dashboard shows stats like total watch time, average ratings, and most-watched genres.  
Users can also leave mini reviews for each item — either public or private.

#### Bulk Upload + CSV Import

I added a bulk import system to quickly upload multiple titles using CSV or custom scripts.  
It uses WebSockets for live progress and TMDB for metadata enrichment.

#### Final Thoughts

This app is now my daily dashboard. It’s personal, fast, and helps me watch with intention instead of mindless scrolling.
