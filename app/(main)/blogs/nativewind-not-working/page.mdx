# NativeWind styles not getting applied in my RN app!!

_Published on August 6, 2025 â€¢ 5 min read_

NativeWind is amazing â€” write Tailwind classes right inside your React Native components.  
But one day, my styles just... stopped working. No errors. No logs. No clue.

I wasted hours debugging it â€” turns out, the solution was surprisingly simple:  
**Create an `/app` folder and move everything inside.**

Let me walk you through what happened ðŸ‘‡

---

#### What Was Working (Initially)

Here was my working `tailwind.config.js`:

<CodeBlock language="javascript" filename="tailwind.config.js">
  {`/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./App.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./screens/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./navigation/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  presets: [require("nativewind/preset")],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};`}
</CodeBlock>

And my folder structure looked like this:

/App.js
/screens
/components
/navigation

Everything worked perfectlyâ€¦ for a while.

---

### The Problem

After a couple of hours, Tailwind styles **randomly stopped applying**.

No changes to config.  
No major code refactor.  
Just randomlyâ€¦ broke.

I tried:

- Restarting Metro
- Clearing cache
- Reinstalling Tailwind + NativeWind
- Verifying paths
- Adding more content globs

Still nothing.

But I did notice one thing:  
**The issue started happening right after I integrated React Navigation.**

That seemed to mess with how NativeWind or Metro was reading file changes.

---

#### The Fix: Create an App Folder

Out of desperation, I created a new `app/` folder and moved all my screens, components, and navigation files into it. Then updated the config like this:

<CodeBlock language="javascript" filename="tailwind.config.js">
  {`/** @type {import('tailwindcss').Config} */
module.exports = {
  content: [
    "./App.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./app/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./app/screens/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./app/components/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
    "./app/navigation/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}",
  ],
  presets: [require("nativewind/preset")],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [],
};`}
</CodeBlock>

Thatâ€™s it. Boom. Styles were back instantly

---

#### Why Did That Work?

Honestly, still a bit of a mystery
My guess is:

- NativeWind's content scanning or Metroâ€™s file watcher was silently failing outside the new structure
- Something in NativeWind's internal behavior prefers the `app/` layout
- File invalidation wasnâ€™t triggering a rebuild

Whatever it is â€” the fix is real.

#### Final Folder Structure

<CustomImage
  src="/native-wind.png"
  alt="Screenshot of React Native folder structure with app folder"
/>

/App.js
/app
/screens
/components
/navigation

And that solved it once and for all.

---

#### Final Thoughts

If NativeWind suddenly stops working even though your config looks perfect, try this:

âœ… **Create an `/app` folder and move everything inside it**  
âœ… **Update `tailwind.config.js` to point to it**

Youâ€™ll save hours of pointless debugging.
