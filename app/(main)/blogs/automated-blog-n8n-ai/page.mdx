# How I Automated My Blog Using n8n + AI

_Published on July 31, 2025 ‚Ä¢ 8 min read_

I love writing. But I hate the grind: researching keywords, formatting markdown, resizing images, and pushing it to my CMS.

So‚Ä¶ I automated everything.

Now I just type a blog idea into the automation ‚Äî 10 minutes later, I‚Äôve got a fully formatted, AI-written post in my website.  
Image, title, metadata ‚Äî done.

## My Workflow

n8n takes over. It handles:

- Keyword suggestions
- AI title generation
- Gmail Verify the titles or ask to rewrite
- Image fetching
- Blog content creation
- Post to my website

All on autopilot.

## Keyword Ideas Without SEO Tools (as they are paid)

To fetch keyword suggestions, n8n calls Google Suggest with a basic HTTP request and extracts data using regex.

<CodeBlock language="javascript" filename="google-keyword-fetch.js">
  {`// n8n HTTP Request Node
const topic = $('Google Sheets').first().$node["Blog Ideas"].json["Topic"];
const url = \`http://suggestqueries.google.com/complete/search?client=firefox&q=\${encodeURIComponent(topic)}\`;`}
</CodeBlock>

## Title Generation with Mistral

The topic is fed to OpenRouter (Mistral 7B), which responds with 5 possible blog titles.

If I reply to the email with:

- `rewrite`: it generates 5 new titles
- `1` to `5`: it locks that title and continues

## Auto Image + Overlay

Using the Unsplash API + an image processing service, it:

- Grabs a relevant image
- Adds a title overlay (styled)
- Saves it to the correct path with proper dimensions

## AI Blog Draft

Once the title‚Äôs locked, another OpenRouter call generates ~800 words of markdown content in my tone.

No fluff. Just usable content.

That‚Äôs it. From idea ‚ûù published post.  
All automated. All mine.
